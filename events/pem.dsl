		<h2>Organisation</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://event.cwi.nl/pem/">PEM</a> is a colloquium held at <a href="http://www.cwi.nl">Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica</a> at least since 1997.</li>
			<li>I was organising this colloquium from January 2012 till August 2013.</li>
			<li>During that time, it was a relatively stable weekly event, only occasionally deviating from the schedule or merging with other events.</li>
			<li>In my design, there were two types of colloquium presentations:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>PEM</strong> (Programming Environment Meeting)
						— usually an invited talk by an external expert about a topic relevant for the <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/sen1">SWAT</a> team, or a presentation by a SWAT member intended for a broader public.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>SEM</strong> (Software Engineering Meeting) — an internally intended talk by members of SWAT to discuss their work in progress with colleagues.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The last organiser before me was Bas Basten, the next one after me was Atze van der Ploeg.</li>
			<li>Information about older talks was semi-automatically extracted by me from the backups of Jurgen Vinju.</li>
		</ul>
