			SATToSE is a three-day yearly event meant for both senior and junior
			(MSc and PhD students) researchers from Belgium, France, Germany, the
			Netherlands, Switzerland and other countries to share their recent and
			upcoming results software evolution, coevoluion of software artefacts,
			software analysis, software visualisation, program transformation,
			grammarware engineering, source code refactoring, software migration,
			reverse engineering, etc. This is mainly a communication and
			collaboration, not a publication event, even though it does have <a
			href="https://dblp.org/db/conf/sattose/">a DBLP page</a> (which I brought to existence).

            <!-- <li>I am planning to attend SATToSE 2021 in July.</li> -->
			<li>At SoTeSoLa 2012, I played roles of a Hackathon Lead Coordinator (<a href="https://github.com/SATToSE/SoTeSoLa2012/wiki/Hackathon/66018edd9f1df26d2c5a45780a88992df28197f2">read the description</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2HfytEOAwA">watch the screencast</a>) and a Social Media Chair (@<a href="https://twitter.com/sotesola">sotesola</a>), as well as participated actively in the school’s design and organisation</li>
			<li>At SATToSE 2012, I gave a presentation and co-represented Rascal at the Technology Showdown and the Hackathon</li>
			<li>At SATToSE 2013, I was the Hackathon Chair, but also gave a talk and represented Rascal at the Technology Showdown</li>
			<li>At SATToSE 2014, I was the Program Chair (<a href="2014.html">behold the programme</a>!) and the Post-proceedings Co-editor (<a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sattose/sattose2014.html">check out the post-proceedings</a>!)</li>
			<li>At SATToSE 2015, I was on the Programme Committee, gave a regular talk and a technology showdown demo, as well as participated in the hackathon.</li>
			<li>At SATToSE 2016, I was a self-proclaimed Social Media Chair (<a href="https://twitter.com/sattose">@sattose</a> had ~300 tweets!), a PC member, chaired a session, co-authored a submission without giving a talk, as well as participated in the hackathon.</li>
			<li>At SATToSE 2017, I was on the Programme Committee and led one of the sides of the tweeting competition (the winning one, of course), against <a href="https://twitter.com/aserebrenik/">Alexander Serebrenik</a></li>
			<li>At SATToSE 2018, I was one of the keynote speakers</li>
			<li>At SATToSE 2023, I was on the Programme Committee and gave a regular talk.</li>
			<li>Since December 2012, I am a Steering Committee member of SATToSE.</li>
